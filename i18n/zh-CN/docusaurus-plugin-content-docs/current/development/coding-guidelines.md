This document describes the coding guidelines for the Datafuse Rust codebase.

## Code formatting

All code formatting is enforced with [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt) with a project-specific configuration. Below is an example command:

```
$ make fmt
```

## Code analysis

[Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) is used to catch common mistakes and is run as a part of continuous integration. Before submitting your code for review, you can run lint:

```
$ make lint
```

## Code documentation

Any public fields, functions, and methods should be documented with [Rustdoc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-02-publishing-to-crates-io.html#making-useful-documentation-comments).

Please follow the conventions as detailed below for modules, structs, enums, and functions. The _single line_ is used as a preview when navigating Rustdoc. As an example, see the 'Structs' and 'Enums' sections in the [collections](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/index.html) Rustdoc.

```rust
/// [Single line] One line summary description
///
/// [Longer description] Multiple lines, inline code
/// examples, invariants, purpose, usage, etc.
[Attributes] If attributes exist, add after Rustdoc
```

Example below:

```rust
/// Represents (x, y) of a 2-dimensional grid
///
/// A line is defined by 2 instances.
/// A plane is defined by 3 instances.
#[repr(C)]
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}
```

## Testing

_Unit tests_

```
$ make unit-test
```

_Stateless tests_

```
$ make stateless-test
```
